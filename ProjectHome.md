E# is an effort to create a programming language suitable for being embedded in various applications on various platforms.
It aims to have a flexible architecture and a clean syntax while keeping the total size of the language under 1MB.
E# is fully object oriented (anything is an object) with pure encapsulation (only private properties) and uses message passing to connect code actions.
